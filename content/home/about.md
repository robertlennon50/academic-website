<!--StartFragment-->

I'm a linguistics researcher at the [Phonetics Lab](http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/phonetics/) at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/). My research is in sociolinguistics, phonetics and speech perception, and I'm interested in how the social aspects of speech communities affect how speech sounds are produced and perceived.

My expertise is in Scottish English (especially phonetic variation in Glasgow), rhoticity, and cross-dialect perception.
